cubix-cpp
=========

A 2D game written in C++ using OpenGL 3.3.

For now this is going to mainly serve as a platform for advancing my C++ knowledge; with a little expirementation thrown in.

To build you are going to need CMake. I've been thinking about trying scons, so i may offer than as an option later on as well.

Dependancies
-------------
SDL2
GLM
CMake
A C++ compiler :P
